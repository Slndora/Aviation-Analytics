## Data Overview
The database consists of eight interconnected tables, each holding vital information about the airline's operations. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of each table:

1) Aircrafts_data: Contains details about each aircraft in the fleet, including the aircraft code, model, and operational range.

2) Airports_data: Provides information about airports, including airport codes, names, cities, geographical coordinates, and time zones.

3) Boarding_passes: Holds records of boarding passes issued, linking ticket numbers with flight IDs, boarding numbers, and seat numbers.

4) Bookings: Captures booking information, including the booking reference, date, and total amount paid.

5) Flights: Details flight operations, including flight IDs, flight numbers, scheduled and actual departure/arrival times, departure airports, flight status, and associated aircraft.

6) Seats: Lists the seating arrangements on each aircraft, including seat numbers and fare conditions.

7) Ticket_flights: Connects tickets to flights, detailing fare conditions and amounts charged for each ticket.

8) Tickets: Contains information about each ticket, linking ticket numbers to booking references and passenger IDs.

## Analysis Goals
1) Flight Performance Analysis:
- Assess the on-time performance of flights by comparing scheduled and actual departure/arrival times.
- Identify patterns in delays and cancellations.
2) Revenue Analysis:
- Analyze total revenue generated from bookings and ticket sales.
- Investigate the impact of different fare conditions on overall revenue.
3) Passenger Behavior:
- Examine booking trends, including peak booking periods and average booking amounts.
- Identify the most popular routes based on ticket sales.
4) Aircraft Utilization:
- Evaluate the operational efficiency of different aircraft models by analyzing flight assignments and range capabilities.
- Assess the distribution of seat types and fare conditions to optimize capacity.
5) Airport Performance:
- Analyze flight traffic at various airports to determine busy and underutilized locations.
- Explore the relationship between airport characteristics (such as timezone and geographical location) and flight performance.
